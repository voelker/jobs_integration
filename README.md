# Jobs Integration

This project is meant to be a test of the full NatureJobs stack, to ensure that all services are playing nicely together.

This test suite will be run on a weekly basis and as such is not a requirement for the automated deploys to QA. But, it is a requirement for the larger manual deploys to staging and live.
